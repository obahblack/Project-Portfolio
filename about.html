									<h3>Obah Praise</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/IMG_6727 (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>Hello there! I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the digital world. My name is Obah Praise, 
										and I'm on an exhilarating journey towards becoming a versatile Full Stack Software Engineer. 
										Currently, I'm immersed in a rigorous bootcamp program, diving deep into the intricacies of modern software development.
									<br> My passion for technology ignited during my undergraduate years at the Federal University of Technology, Minna, 
									where I pursued a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. It was here that I honed my problem-solving skills and 
									developed a keen interest in innovation. While my academic background laid a solid foundation, 
									I found myself drawn towards the dynamic and ever-evolving realm of software engineering.
									<br> Driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to create meaningful impact, I made the pivotal decision to 
									transition into the world of software development. Embracing this new path, I embarked on my journey to master 
									the art and science of coding. Enrolling in the Full Stack Software Engineering track has been an exhilarating experience, 
									pushing me to explore the depths of both frontend and backend development.
									<br>As a Full Stack Software Engineer in training, I thrive in the exhilarating chaos of problem-solving 
									and the satisfaction of turning ideas into reality through code. From crafting elegant user interfaces to architecting robust backend systems, 
									I relish every opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital landscape.
